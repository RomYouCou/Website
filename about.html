<p>We are the Romsey Youth Council (RYC), we do lots of different things to benefit and put forward the opinions of youth in romsey. We have done several Youth Conferences where we have taken about 50 pupils from Romsey and Mountbatten School and have made reports following with the information we gathered. We also organize Band Nights/Gigs where usually local youth bands come and play to a large audience, this is a great fun night out. We also organize a stage at the beggars fair in Memorial Park where youth can perform there talents to a wider audience which is also great fun!</p>

<p>The Romsey Youth Council usually meet on the first Tuesday of every month at Youth in Romsey, 23 Bell Street, Romsey. Youth in Romsey is above the Apollo video shop. All young people aged 11-19 are invited to come along to our nect meeting, to find out when the next one is on please visit the events section.</p>
