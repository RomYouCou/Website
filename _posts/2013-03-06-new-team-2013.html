<h4>New Team. Join Us</h4>
It's been a while since we've had much activity as a Youth Council, however, this is about to change. Today we had a meetup with a group of young people interested in joining and making Romsey the place it should be for Young People.

From this we've set a date for our next meeting: <em>Tuesday 19th March, 18:00-19:30 @ <a href="http://yir.org.uk/contact-us/find-us/">Youth in Romsey</a></em>. The meeting is open to anyone who's interested in joining. For the near future we will be concentrating on the Beggars Fair Youth Festival. But we have other projects starting and if you have something you want additional support for, come along and tell us!
<h4>Beggars Fair 2013 Youth Stage</h4>
Over the past couple of weeks we've been asked (a lot), what's happening with the Beggars Fair stage? Can band/artists apply to play yet? among others.

We are planning to go ahead once again this year and will open for applications from bands/artists in a few weeks. If you'd like to get involved with the organisation and running of the event, we'd love to hear from you!

If you have any further questions please [contact us]. We're a friendly bunch, promise!
