We have been very busy organising the youth festival in Memorial Park for saturday 9<sup>th</sup> July 2011. We are working with <a title="Naomi House Website" href="http://www.naomihouse.org.uk/">Naomi House and Jacks Place</a> (hospice for children and young adults) to offer a variety of different activities for everyone to take part in whilst enjoying the 9 musical acts we have playing on the main stage.

If you would like to donate some of your time on the day to help with this event please contact us using the form on the 'Contact Us' page.

For more information and description of bands go to <a href="http://www.ryc.org.uk/beggarsfair2011/">www.ryc.org.uk/beggarsfair2011/</a> .
