This year for our annual Beggars Fair Youth Stage we have had an amazing number of artists apply to play! As you may know if you follow our <a title="Our Twitter" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> or <a title="Our Facebook Page" href="http://facebook.com/RomYouCou">Facebook Page</a> we have announced the <a title="Beggars Fair Youth Stage Minisite" href="http://ryc.org.uk/beggarsfair2012/">lineup</a>. For those of you unaware or unsure of it the event is a free public music festival that promotes our local music talent. The event this year is to be held on Saturday 14th July 2012 between 12-6PM.

Once again we have the lovely big stage booked, lots of brilliant music and some stalls from <a href="http://www.naomihouse.org.uk/">Naomi House</a> who we are supporting again this year.
