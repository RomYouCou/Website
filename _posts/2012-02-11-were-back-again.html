I know it's february already and this post is kind of marking the first of the new year but anyway, we've had a break and are now back and raring to go. We are starting to prepare for our now well known <a title="Beggars Fair Youth Stage 2012 Mini Site" href="http://www.ryc.org.uk/beggarsfair2012/">Youth Stage</a> during the <a title="Main Beggars Fair Site" href="http://www.beggars-fair.org.uk/">Beggars Fair</a> which will be happening (all being well) on Saturday 14th July 2012. Any bands or interested in playing please and anyone interested in helping out let us know... have a look at the <a title="RYC's Youth Stage 2012 Mini Site" href="http://www.ryc.org.uk/beggarsfair2012/">mini site</a> for more info.

We are also going to be popping into Romsey and Mountbatten Schools in the near future to hold meetings for anyone interested in joining us or just helping out at the odd event but we shall keep you informed about when they are here, on <a title="RYC's Facebook Page" href="http://www.facebook.com/RomYouCou">Facebook</a> and on <a title="RYC's Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/RomYouCou">Twitter</a>.
