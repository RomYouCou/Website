We have some news for you!

First of all we are currently one of Waitrose's (Romsey) charities for December, so when you are shopping there make sure you get a green token and drop it in the Romsey Youth Council Section! The money that we get will be going directly towards the Beggars Fair Youth Stage 2012 and possibly a few Youth Gigs at The Lantern (Mountbatten School) beforehand.

Beggars Fair comes round very quickly as there is a lot of work in making it happen, If you would like to help we will be having a meetup in January and will be inviting new members along.

If you are interested in playing please get in touch with us across facebook, twitter, email (contact@ryc.org.uk) or by speaking to any of our members.

To keep updated make sure to follow us on Twitter (<a title="RYC Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/RomYouCou">@RomYouCou</a>) and <a href="http://facebook.com/RomYouCou">Facebook </a>
