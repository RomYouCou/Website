On the 23rd of January 2009 we ran a youth conference for young people. 50 pupils from both Romsey &amp; Mountbatten school came down to the Crosfield Hall in Romsey and took part in three workshops that we had organised, also then in the afternoon we had organised for a drama company to come in and peform a play on our main topic (Global Issues).

We also run Band Nights (Gigs). This is where bands from Mountbatten &amp; Romsey school come and peform their music we find that the Band Nights are very popular with young people.
