<p>We've left it a bit late but anyway we'd like to thank everyone who supported us on the day, the bands, RYC team, Gordon Clarke and everyone that turned up!</p>


<p>We have uploaded some pictures that we got on the day to our <a title="Beggars Fair (Youth Stage) 2012" href="http://www.ryc.org.uk/gallery/beggars-fair-youth-stage-2012/">gallery</a>.</p>


<p>Hopefully we will be able to get support for running the event in 2012 due to there being a lot of time and effort put in even before the day we are always looking for new members and of course financial support to put these sort of events together. If you are interested in joining us or just fancy a chat to see what it's all about drop us an email to contact@ryc.org.uk.</p>
